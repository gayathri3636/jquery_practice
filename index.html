<!--
jquery file can be downloaded from CDN server that is closest to user. 
        
browser caching-- If user already visited webpage that uses jquery
from a CDN and then if he arrives at your page the file has already been cached by browser so no need 
to download again  
       
Parallel downloads--allows 2 parallel downloads on CDN server
        
Reduced server load
        
Disadvantages--Client firewalls may block the CDN so you may have to request
your clients to whitelist the CDN.
        
If CDN doesnt work then we have to write fallback code to use our jquery file which we
attached in our application.
